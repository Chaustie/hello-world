# hello-world
My tutorial repository.
I am addicted to audiobooks. My favorite genres are fantasy and sci-fi. I also really love getting on Youtube and watching videos on my favorite video games. I rarely have time to actually play video games anymore though. A vague goal I have for the future is to write a book or book series of my own. My current goal is to try to learn some programming languages so I have a more marketable skill with a creative outlet. I want to make things.
